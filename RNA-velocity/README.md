RNA Velocity in Single cells -  An analysis of Publicly available datasets.

#### Datasets analyzed - 
1. Dentate gyrus has functions in memory formation and depression. It serves more as a pre-processing unit. It is one of a select few brain structures known to have significant rates of adult neurogenesis in many species of mammals, from rodents to primates. It is a site for new cells formation throughout life in the brain. [scvelo]
2. HNSCs are Multipotent cells which are able to self-renew and proliferate without limit, to produce progeny cells which terminally differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.[zenodo - https://zenodo.org/record/5712100#.Yl94T_PMJhE]
3. Neuronal splicing dataset - Timely expression and perhaps post-translational modification of neuron-specific splicing regulators play important roles in neuronal development. During neuronal differentiation, alternative splicing modulates signaling activity, centriolar dynamics, and metabolic pathways. [dynamo]

#### Software - 
1. scvelo
2. dynamo
3. velocyto

Note - Please refer the notebook for the functions used and the PDF file for the analysis and plots.

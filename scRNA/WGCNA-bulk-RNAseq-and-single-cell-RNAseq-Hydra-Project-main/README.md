Scripts written by Lisa Yeter Mesrop accompanying the publication Single cell analysis reveals the molecular signaling and cellular composition of the regnerating Hydra Head Authors: Aide Macias-Mu√±oz, Lisa Y. Mesrop, Heidi Yahan Liang and Ali Mortazavi.

The scripts below perform the following:
- Read mapping of Bulk RNA-Seq Hydra Regeneration and Hypostome (Murad and Macias-Munoz et al., 2021) with Kallisto 
- Count normalization with DESeq2 
- Gene network analysis with WGCNA 
- GO enrichment with topGO
- Network Visualization

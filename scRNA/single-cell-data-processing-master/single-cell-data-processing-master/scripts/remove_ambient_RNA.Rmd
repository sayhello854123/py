# General overview of the data
Load data and plot clusters
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sc <- load10X(snakemake@params$input)
dd <- sc$metaData
mids <- aggregate(cbind(tSNE1,tSNE2) ~ clusters,data=dd,FUN=mean)

ggplot(dd,aes(tSNE1,tSNE2)) + geom_point(aes(colour=factor(clusters)),size=0.2) + geom_label(data=mids,aes(label=clusters))
```

# Ambient RNA correction
## Estimate rho, the contamination fraction
```{r}
sc = autoEstCont(sc)
```

## Correct the expression profile
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
out = adjustCounts(sc)
```

## Looking at changes in expression
Looking at the fraction of cells that had non zero expression and that after the correction have zero expression
```{r}
cntSoggy <- rowSums(sc$toc > 0)
cntStrained <- rowSums(out > 0)
tail(sort((cntSoggy - cntStrained)/cntSoggy), n = 10)
```

# Plot expression of 5 genes most affected by correction - before correction
```{r}
difference_after_correction <- tail(sort(rowSums(sc$toc > out)/rowSums(sc$toc > 0)), n = 5)
difference_after_correction
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(difference_after_correction)){
    gene <- names(difference_after_correction[i])
    dd[[gene]] = sc$toc[gene, ]
    plot(ggplot(dd, aes(tSNE1,tSNE2)) + geom_point(aes(colour = get(gene) > 0))+ ggtitle(paste0(gene, ": expression before correction")))
}
```

# Plot ratio of observed to expected counts
How many counts would be expected if that droplet were nothing but soup and compares that to the observed count.  
If it's more than expected by change, it means that it is probably a true signal - the gene is expressed in those cells.  
Black dots - cells with no expression for that gene  
Red dots - the gene is expressed far more than expected by chance  
Blue dots - the expression shown might be due to contamination and is not a true signal

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(difference_after_correction)){
    gene <- names(difference_after_correction[i])
    plot(plotMarkerMap(sc, gene))
}
```

# Plot expression of 5 genes most affected by correction - after correction
Comparing corrected/raw expression. Fraction of expression in each cell that has been deemed as soup and removed.  
Visualise how the expression of a geneSet changes after soup correction.  

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(difference_after_correction)){
    gene <- names(difference_after_correction[i])
    plot(plotChangeMap(sc,out, gene))
}
```

# Plot expression of 5 random genes before correction
```{r}
toc_dataframe <- data.frame(sc$toc)
gene_names <- rownames(toc_dataframe)
set.seed(1)
sampled_genes <- sample(x = gene_names, size =5, replace = FALSE)
```

```{r}
for (gene in sampled_genes){
    dd[[gene]] = sc$toc[gene, ]
    plot(ggplot(dd, aes(tSNE1,tSNE2)) + geom_point(aes(colour = get(gene) > 0))+ ggtitle(paste0(gene, ": expression before correction")))
